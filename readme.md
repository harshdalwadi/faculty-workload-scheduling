# Faculty Workload Scheduling – BA + ETL + BI Project

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **university faculty workload scheduling system** to demonstrate both **Business Analyst skills** (requirements, process mapping, UAT) and **technical skills** (ETL, SQL, Python, Power BI).

The project mirrors real-world initiatives such as **ERP configuration, compliance validation, and workload dashboards**.

## 📂 Deliverables
- **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** → [`/docs/brd/`](docs/business_requirements_document/Faculty_Workload_BRD_v0.1.md)
- **Process Maps (Current vs Future state)** → [`/docs/process_maps/`](./docs/process_maps/)
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** → [`/docs/erd/`](./docs/erd/)
- **ETL Validation Rules** (SQL + Python) → [`/data/sql/`](./data/sql/)
- **Power BI Dashboard** → [`/reports/`](./reports/Dashboard.pbix)
- **UAT Test Cases** → [`/reports/`](./reports/issue_log_export.csv)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **SQL Server / PostgreSQL** → ETL & validation queries  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** → data validation, conflict detection  
- **Power BI** → dashboards & reporting  
- **Visio / draw.io** → process maps, ERD

## 📊 Dashboards

This project delivers a series of Power BI dashboards built on top of validated and curated data. Each page provides a different perspective on faculty workload scheduling.

### 1. Overview Dashboard
Gives a high-level summary of teaching workload across all terms. Highlights total sections, scheduled hours, faculty, and courses. Also shows workload distribution by department, term, and delivery mode, along with top faculty by load.

### 2. Faculty Profile
Drill-down into an individual faculty member’s workload. Displays their assignments, total hours vs. maximum load, department, employment type, and whether they are overloaded.

### 3. Course Profile
Course-centric view showing course details (code, department, credits, contact hours) and workload distribution across sections, delivery modes, terms, and assigned faculty.

## 📝 Validation & Exceptions Evidence
All data quality checks (FR-01 to FR-05) are logged in the `issue_log` table.  
![UAT_Testing](screenshots/UAT_Testing.png)

It contains:
- RuleName (Overload, Unassigned, DepartmentMismatch, DuplicateSection, BadHours)
- Severity (High/Medium)
- TableName and RowKey (to locate the issue)
- Details (what was wrong)
- Status (Open/Closed)
